INTRODUCTION

This document tries to describe how the icons have been created. The idea behind
the icons are functionalism and that they can be created quickly, without any
artistic talents whatsoever.

HOW?

1.  Draw the image with the worlds best drawing program, xfig. Using it gives a
    nice 1980s style to the icons.

2.  As a reference save the drawing in the native fig format.

3.  In xfig, click File->Export

4.  Select 'Language', to PNG.

5.  Export the file to a PNG file.

6.  Open the PNG file in gimp, if you are asked convert it to sRGB, accept it by
    pressing Convert.

7.  If the size is not square, then make it square by selecting the whole
    picture and copying it into new picture. When you push 'New...' you can set
    the size in the following dialog. Make the size square by setting the
    smaller dimension to the same as the larger.

8.  If you have copied the picture, you will need to flatten it by selecting
    'Image->Flatten Image'

9.  In the gimp menu, select 'Layer->Transparency->Color' to Alpha

10. The above should open a dialog where you are allowed to convert a color to
    transparency, white should be the default, so you should only have to click
    OK.

11. Save this intermediary result in the PNG format, that is use 'Export As' in
    the menu.

12. Scale the image to size 30x30. It happens with the menu 'Image->Scale Image'
    You should select Interpolation to be 'Sinc (Lanczos3)'.

13. Save the scaled image as a PNG with 'Export As'. Add '30x30' to the base
    file name.
