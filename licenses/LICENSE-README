PURPOSE

This file is just a brief overview and clarification of the current license
situation of Traceshark.

GPL in this document refers to the GNU General Public License.

ABOUT LICENSES

* Most source files of Traceshark are dual licensed. These files are clearly
  marked as such by the comment in the beginning of each file. The files can
  be used either under the terms of the GPL version 2 or later, or under the
  terms of the two clause BSD license.

* The only exception to the above is that Tracehsark includes a copy of
  QCustomPlot. QCustomPlot is licensed under the GPL version 3 or later.

* Currently tracehsark is dependent on QCustomPlot, so in order to compile
  a working binary, you need to choose the GPL version 3 for the program as
  a whole because GPL version 2 is not compatible with GPL version 3. This is
  also the reason why Traceshark only displays the GPL version 3 in its user
  interface, since for all practical purposes it is the licensing terms that
  apply to the program.
 
* However, if Traceshark is modified to not include QCustomPlot, then it will
  be possible to chose the license. This also include the scenario where code
  from dual licensed files are used in another work, where QCustomPlot is not
  used at all.
